The structure of this project is as follows:
hw1
|- server.py: The location of the code for the TCP socket server
|- httplib/: a library (I wrote for this project) to parse and handle default requests
   |- __init__.py: allows me to import and run functions from python files in this directory
   |- directory.py [not in use]: a class I wrote to iterate through files in a directory.
   |                             I was thinking about using them to iterate through images,
   |                             but I found a better solution
   |
   |- parse.py: a library of functions I wrote to parse requests and format responses
   |- response.py: a series of default responses (200, 301, 404) created using parse.py functions with default parameters

|- index.html: HTML front page

   |- style.css: stylesheet for '/'

|- js/: a directory containing all JavaScript
   |- script.js: js for '/'

|- image/: a directory containing all images on the website
|- utf.txt: a utf text file

|- test_parse.py: a test suite for parsing requests and formatting responses properly
|- Dockerfile
